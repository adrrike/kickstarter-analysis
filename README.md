# An Analysis of kickstarter campaigns
Performed a statistical analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for an aspiring playwright. 

![Line_Chart](path/to/Line_Chart.png)
Most successful theater productions launched in the early summer (May/June/July).
Ideally, May is the best month to launch a theater productions as 66% were successful. 

Most successful US plays had fundrasing goals between $1,500 and $5,000. 
Most failed US plays had fundrasing goals over $5,000. 

![Musicals](path/to/Musicals.png) 
50% of Great Britain musicals had fundraising goals between $538 and $5,625, however 50% of musicals only raised between $28 and $1,496 with the very top musical only raising $3,015. If you write a musical in Great Britain I would recommend a budget of no more than $1,496. 


I would recommend writing a US play with a launch date in May, a fundraising goal of approximately $3,000.
