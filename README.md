# An Analysis of kickstarter campaigns
Performed a statistical analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for an aspiring playwright.

Most successful theater productions launched in the early summer (May/June/July).
Ideally, May is the best month to launch a theater productions as 66% were successful. 

Most successful US plays had fundrasing goals between $1,500 and $5,000. 
Most failed US plays had fundrasing goals over $5,000.

The middle 50% of Great Britain musicals had fundraising goals between $538 and $5,625, however the middle 50% of musicals only raised between $28 and $1,496 with the #1 top musical only raising $3,015. If you write a musical in Great Britain I would recommend a budget of no more than $1,496. 


Based on my analysis of the kickstarter campaigns, I would recommend writing a US play with a launch date in May and a fundraising goal of approximately $3,000.
