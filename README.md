# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

Louise is an inspiring playwright who is interested in finding out how different fundraising campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. For this analysis, we will look particularily at Theater productions and then a more in-depth look at Plays. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84742544/123671616-79d2d700-d80c-11eb-90c1-646d3698acb1.png)

Theater productions launched in May have the most success. 

Theater productions launched in December have the worst chance of success.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

![Outcomes_vs_Goals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84742544/123671610-78091380-d80c-11eb-831b-fb235f3346a8.png)

Plays with the fundraising goals under $1000 have the most success(76%) in reaching their goals. 

Plays with a fundraising goal of over $50000 only have a 13% chance of success. 

The chance of successfully meeting the fund raising goal drops by 18% once the goal is over $5000. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Theater Outcomes by Launch Date graph is only numerical values, without looking at percentage it's difficult to identify the most chance of success by month. 

Theater Outcomes by Launch Date is a parent category, whereas Outcomes Based on Goals is based on subcategory "plays". If you were writing a play, it would be best to filter down Launch Date to the "Plays" subcategory for more relevant data. 

Outcome Based on Goals data is skewed as 889 projects had a goal under $9,999 and only 158 projects had a goal over $9,999. It might be best to further analyze the projects with goals under the $9,999 for additional insights. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Theater productions launched in early to mid-summer(May, June, July) have the most success. 
Theater productions launched in December have the least succcess. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Most successful plays have fundraising goals under $4,999. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Not a deep enough dive into the 889 plays with fundraising goals under $9,999. 
We didn't filter based on country. Plays in different countries could vary drastically. 
The entertainment data didn't wasn't categorized(comedy, drama, tragedy), would could lead to additional insights on what entertainment categories are meeting fundraising goals and which are not. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Theater Outcomes by Launch Date could be filtered down to show the Subcategory "Plays"
Theater Outcomes by Launch Date could be graphed by percentage of success/failures for better insights past the numerical data.
A clustered column chart would be another good visualization for looking at Outcomes Based on Goals. 



# Kickstarter Analysis

Performed a statistical analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for an aspiring playwright. 

![Line Chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84742544/123641801-a678f580-d7f0-11eb-82fc-d70e5f0a6bc0.png)

Most successful theater productions launched in the early summer (May/June/July).
Ideally, May is the best month to launch a theater productions as 66% were successful. 

Most successful US plays had fundrasing goals between $1,500 and $5,000. 
Most failed US plays had fundrasing goals over $5,000. 

![Musicals](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84742544/123641922-c1e40080-d7f0-11eb-845b-8a981af345b3.png)

The middle 50% of Great Britain musicals had fundraising goals between $538 and $5,625, however the middle 50% of musicals only raised between $28 and $1,496 with the #1 top musical only raising $3,015. If you write a musical in Great Britain I would recommend a budget of no more than $1,496. 


##Final Recommendations:
Based on my analysis of the kickstarter campaigns, I would recommend writing a US play with a launch date in May and a fundraising goal of approximately $3,000.
